Here are a few famous quotes from Earl Nightingale:

"Success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal or ideal."

"We become what we think about."

"The greatest tragedy in life is not death, but a life without a purpose."

"The mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions."

"The person with a fixed goal, a clear picture of his desire, or an ideal always before him, causes it, through repetition, to be buried deeply in his subconscious 
mind and is thus enabled, thanks to its generative and sustaining power, to realize his goal in a minimum of time and with a minimum of physical effort."

"The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today."

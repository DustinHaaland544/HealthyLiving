The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, where the first cases of COVID-19 were initially linked, is located in the city's Jianghan District. The exact 
address of the market is No. 1 Jinyintan Avenue, a few kilometers from the city center. The market covers an area of approximately 50,000 square meters and is known for 
selling a variety of live and dead animals, including seafood, poultry, and exotic animals such as snakes and civet cats. However, it is important to note that while the 
market may have played a role in the early spread of the virus, it is not clear if it was the sole source of transmission, as the virus has since been found to be 
circulating in other parts of the city, and potentially even outside of China, prior to the identification of the first cases linked to the market.

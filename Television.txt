The invention of television involved the contributions of many inventors and scientists over several decades. However, the first practical television system was 
demonstrated by Philo Farnsworth in 1927.

Farnsworth was an American inventor who had been working on a system for transmitting images electronically since he was a teenager. In 1927, he successfully transmitted 
a moving image using his system, which he called an "image dissector." This event is generally considered to be the birth of television.

It's worth noting that other inventors, such as John Logie Baird in the UK and Vladimir Zworykin in the US, were also working on television systems around the same time. 
However, Farnsworth's system proved to be the most practical and became the basis for modern television technology.

Television is a technology that allows us to transmit moving images and sound over long distances. The invention of television involved the contributions of many 
inventors and scientists over several decades. Here is a brief history of the invention and progression of television:

1878: The first image transmission was accomplished by Eadweard Muybridge using a series of still photographs.
1884: Paul Nipkow, a German inventor, designed the first mechanical television system using a rotating disk with holes.
1925: John Logie Baird, a Scottish inventor, demonstrated the first television system that transmitted a moving image using a mechanical system.
1927: Philo Farnsworth, an American inventor, demonstrated the first practical electronic television system.
1939: The first television broadcast was aired by the BBC in the UK, and the first television sets were sold to the public.
1941: Commercial television broadcasting began in the US.
1951: The first color television broadcast was aired in the US.
1962: The first communication satellite, Telstar, was launched, allowing television signals to be transmitted around the world.
1965: The first commercial satellite, Early Bird, was launched, allowing television networks to transmit live events around the world.
1972: The first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, was released.
1980s: Cable television became widely available, offering viewers many more channels and programming options.
1990s: Digital television technology was developed, providing higher quality images and sound.
2000s: High-definition television (HDTV) became the standard for television broadcasting in many countries.
2010s: Streaming television services like Netflix and Hulu became popular, allowing viewers to watch television shows and movies on demand.

Over the years, television technology has continued to evolve and improve, providing us with a wealth of entertainment, information, and communication options. 
Today, we can watch television on our computers, smartphones, and other mobile devices, and the future of television is sure to bring even more exciting innovations.

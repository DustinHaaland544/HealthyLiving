Regular green tea and tropical green tea are both based on green tea leaves, but they differ in terms of flavor, ingredients, and preparation. 
Here are the key differences:

Flavor and Aroma:

Regular Green Tea: Regular green tea has a mild, slightly grassy, and vegetal flavor. It has a subtle, earthy aroma and a clean, refreshing taste. 
The flavor of green tea can vary depending on factors like the region where it's grown and how it's processed.

Tropical Green Tea: Tropical green tea is infused with various tropical fruits and herbs to give it a fruity and exotic flavor. Depending on the blend, 
it can have notes of citrus, pineapple, mango, passion fruit, or other tropical flavors. The aroma is often more vibrant and sweet compared to regular 
green tea.

Ingredients:

Regular Green Tea: Traditional green tea is made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. It is minimally processed and contains no added flavors or
ingredients. The variations in green tea flavors come from factors like the tea's origin and how it's prepared.

Tropical Green Tea: Tropical green tea is a flavored tea that includes ingredients like dried fruits, herbs, and spices. These additional ingredients 
contribute to the tropical flavor and aroma. Some common ingredients in tropical green tea blends include hibiscus, dried pineapple, coconut, and 
various fruit extracts.

Health Benefits:

Regular Green Tea: Green tea is known for its numerous health benefits, which include antioxidants, potential weight management support, and 
improved heart health. These benefits are primarily attributed to the natural compounds found in the green tea leaves, such as catechins and 
polyphenols.

Tropical Green Tea: While tropical green tea still contains the health benefits of green tea itself, the additional ingredients can provide 
their own health benefits. For example, hibiscus is often used in tropical blends and is known for its potential to lower blood pressure 
and provide antioxidants.

Preparation:

Regular Green Tea: Preparing regular green tea involves steeping the tea leaves in hot water (typically around 175°F or 80°C) for a few minutes. 
It's usually recommended to avoid using boiling water to prevent bitterness.

Tropical Green Tea: Preparing tropical green tea is similar to regular green tea, with the added step of steeping the blend of tea and ingredients. 
The steeping time and temperature may vary based on the specific blend, so it's essential to follow the instructions provided with the tea.

In summary, regular green tea is a pure, unflavored tea made from green tea leaves, while tropical green tea is a flavored tea with a variety of tropical 
fruits and herbs, providing a different taste experience. The choice between the two depends on personal preference for flavor and any additional health 
benefits you may be seeking from the extra ingredients in the tropical blend.

HOW do you make friends while traveling SOLO?!

"How do I make friends? What If I just end up being lonely?"

This is one of the most common questions I get on Instagram. The thought of making friends while travelling solo can be intimidating,

especially if you are an introvert or just going solo for the first time!

But trust me, this fear will fade away as soon as you go for the first “hi”.

As I always say, traveling solo is just traveling with friends you haven’t met yet. Here are some ways you can meet people while traveling solo -

Pick hostels over hotels. All Hostels have common areas and dorm rooms which makes socializing very easy! Hostels also see a lot of solo travelers, 
 
so it’s the easiest way to meet new people
 
Don’t like hostels? No worries! Go for an Airbnb with a local host. This was you won’t only make a new friend, 
 
but would truly be able to immerse yourself in the culture and local way of living

Go on a walking tour! Walking tours are a great way to meet new people, you always go in big groups and people from all over the world join in.
This is a great opportunity to meet like minded people 

Volunteer if you’ve got the time. Find a school, hostel, hotel etc. that needs volunteers and work there - this is probably the most amazing way 

to meet people and also understand the local culture

The best conversation starter according to me is - "Where are you from?/ What's a good cafe here?”

Or “How long have you been traveling for?” Simple questions help you break the ice. Don’t overthink it!

Making friends is not as scary as it feels. You just need to have an open heart and take your first step!
